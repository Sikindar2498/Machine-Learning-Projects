# Handwritten Digits Recognition
This Machine learning Model is done by Chundi Nanda Gopal reddy for insitutional purposes. The model can still be improved and updated in future.
This repository contains resources to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of the 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9 using machine learning.

# Dataset Information
The dataset contains 60,000 small square 28 x 28 pixel greyscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 to 9.
